Today I am learning about FTP.
First time I used the dir command in CMD to list all files.

From Cisco Academy I am learning about FTP protocol.

FTP is used for file transfer.

The client first uses FTP on port 21 to connect to the server, and for uploading or downloading it uses port 20.

Now I am learning how to upload an image to an FTP server.

I used the command:
ftp 209.165.200.226
Then the message: Connected to 209.165.200.226

Then I used dir to see all files on the server.

Enter username: _
Enter password: _

To upload a file:
put xyzFilename.txt
(Successful upload)

To download a file from the server:
get xyzFilename.txt

To delete a file:
delete xyzFilename.txt
