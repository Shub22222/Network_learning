The netstat -ano command is useful for network monitoring and troubleshooting.

It helps to:

Perform security checks by identifying unknown or suspicious active connections.

Troubleshoot applications that are not running due to port conflicts.

Check which ports are open or listening on the system.

View active network connections and their status.

Identify which process (PID) is using a particular port.

Identify which protocol is being used by each connection (e.g., TCP or UDP).
