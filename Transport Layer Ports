Transport Layer Ports

- Ports below 1024 are called Well-Known Ports.
- These ports are used by server applications (known fixed services).
- Example: HTTP - 80, FTP - 21, 

- Client uses Dynamic (Ephemeral) Ports automatically generated above 1024.
- Client source port is random, for example 50123, 53000, 60010, etc.

Example Connection:
Client (Source Port 54012) → Server (Destination Port 80)
then server wil listen only port 80.
Server (Source Port 80) → Client (Destination Port 54012)
