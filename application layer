client server relationship


How a Client Accesses a Website (Application Layer Flow)

When a client wants to access a website (for example: www.cisco.com), it first needs to obtain the IP address of that website. Network devices communicate using IP addresses, not domain names.

🔁 Step-by-Step Process
1. User Types Website URL

The user enters the URL www.cisco.com into the web browser.

2. DNS Lookup Begins

Since the client does not know the IP address, it performs a DNS query.

The client sends a request using UDP to the DNS server.

Port used: 53

Purpose: Convert domain name ➝ IP address

3. DNS Server Responds

The DNS server returns the IP address (example: 192.0.2.5).

4. TCP Connection to Web Server

Now the client initiates a TCP three-way handshake with the server IP.

Port 80 → HTTP (Unsecured website)

Port 443 → HTTPS (Secure website)

5. HTTP Request Sent

After establishing the TCP session, the client sends:

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.cisco.com
6. Server Responds with HTML

The server sends the requested web page data.

7. Browser Renders Page

The webpage is displayed to the user.

📌 Summary Diagram
Client → DNS Query (UDP Port 53) → DNS Server → Returns IP Address
Client → TCP Handshake (Port 80/443) → Web Server
Client → HTTP GET Request → Server Sends HTML
Browser Displays Web Page
📍 Key Point

First UDP for DNS lookup → Then TCP handshake → Then HTTP/HTTPS request → Server sends HTML
