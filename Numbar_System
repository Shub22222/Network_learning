decimal to binary
128 ->   128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
          1   0  0  0 0 0 0 0

decimal to hex
128 -> 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
        1   0  0  0 0 0 0 0

      now it's time to split in 2 parts

        1   0  0  0      0 0 0 0

      now for each part write with 8 4 2 1.  
     8 4 2 1      8 4 2 1
     1 0 0 0      0 0 0 0

        |           |     
       \ /         \ /
        8           0

  Answer  is 128 = 0x80    in  hexadecimal..
